  "Encrypted ClientHello — [draft-ietf-tls-esni-25](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/).

  The client sends **two** ClientHellos: a `ClientHelloOuter` naming the
  client-facing server's `public_name`, and a `ClientHelloInner` — the real
  one, with the real SNI — encrypted with HPKE into the outer's
  `encrypted_client_hello` extension. A network observer sees the public
  name; the client-facing server decrypts and forwards the inner to the
  backend.

  ## Not an RFC

  ECH is `draft-ietf-tls-esni-25`, not an RFC, and it publishes **no test
  vectors**. That is measured, not assumed: the datatracker gives the document
  no RFC number, and the draft text contains no test vector section.

  So the evidence here is of three kinds, and they are kept apart:

  - **live configurations.** `test/tls/ech_configs.cljc` holds `ECHConfigList`
    values published in real HTTPS resource records — Cloudflare's and
    defo.ie's, the latter carrying three configs. Parsing bytes that are
    actually deployed is the only part of this that is not self-consistency.
  - **two-sided round-trip.** Everything a client does here has a server-side
    counterpart in the same file, and the tests run both.
  - **the aborts.** §5.1 names four conditions under which a server MUST
    abort while reconstructing the inner. Each has a test, and each is
    asserted by its own reason.

  ## What is here and what is not

  This is the ECH **data plane**: configurations, the encoding and
  reconstruction of `EncodedClientHelloInner`, `ClientHelloOuterAAD`, the HPKE
  seal and open, and the acceptance confirmation.

  It is **not wired into `tls.client`** yet. Offering ECH in a live handshake
  additionally needs HelloRetryRequest handling, the retry-config path of
  §6.1.6, and a second transcript — and doing that halfway would produce a
  client that offers ECH and cannot tell whether it was accepted, which is
  worse than one that does not offer it."

  halves live in this file, so replacing the info with anything at all leaves
  every two-sided test green; it is only wrong against a peer. Measured:
  dropping `(:raw config)` broke nothing until this got an assertion of its
  own, pinned to the draft's text rather than to the other half of the code.

(defn seal
  "§6.1.1. Returns the finished ClientHelloOuter body.

  Note the error context key is `:tls/hpke-reason`, not `:tls/reason`.
  `tls.result/error` merges the caller's data *over* `{:tls/alert :tls/reason}`,
  so a context map carrying `:tls/reason` silently replaces the stable keyword
  the caller asserts on. That was a real bug here, caught only because the
  tests assert **by reason** rather than by \"an error happened\".

  `partial-outer` must already carry an `encrypted_client_hello` extension
  whose payload is `L` zeros, where `L` is the sealed length — the draft says
  so, and the reason is that the AAD is the serialized outer, so the payload's
  *length* has to be settled before the payload's *value* can be computed."
