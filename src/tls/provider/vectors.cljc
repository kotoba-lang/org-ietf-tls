  "Adapt a `tls.provider` -- which speaks **byte arrays** -- to the byte-vector
  representation the protocol layer uses.

  ## Why there are two representations at all

  `tls.record`, `tls.schedule`, `tls.handshake` and `tls.codec` work in
  `vector<int 0..255>`, the contract `kotoba-lang/bytes`, `kotoba-lang/noise`
  and `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-asn1` already share. That is not a preference: byte
  vectors have value equality, so `(= expected actual)` on a 679-octet record
  is a real assertion and a test failure prints the divergence. Byte arrays
  compare by identity, and a suite written against them would be asserting
  `java.util.Arrays/equals` everywhere or, worse, asserting nothing.

  `tls.provider` speaks byte arrays because that is what the JDK's
  `MessageDigest`, `Mac`, `Cipher` and `Signature` take, and because a provider
  is on the hot path.

  Both choices are right for their side. What is *not* right is converting ad
  hoc at each of the eleven call sites, so the conversion is here, once.

  ## The conversion is `asn1.core`'s

  `asn1/->ints` and `asn1/ints->bytes` are the workspace's existing seam
  between these two representations, already a direct dependency, already
  tested. Writing a third pair here would be the same defect this consolidation
  exists to remove.

  ## `adapt` measures before it returns

  A provider is checked against published known answers at wiring time --
  SHA-256 of the empty string (FIPS 180-4), HMAC-SHA-256 from RFC 4231 test
  case 1, and RFC 7748 §5.2's X25519 vector -- and the adapted map is returned
  only if they all reproduce.

  This is not ceremony. The failure it exists for is specific and silent: the
  provider returns `[:error :hash/bad-input]` when it is handed something that
  is not a byte array, and `[:error :hash/bad-input]` is *itself a vector*.
  Passing it on as a hash gives the key schedule a two-element \"digest\" that
  derives secrets nobody agrees with, and the handshake fails on the far side
  with no local diagnostic. Checking the shape once, against an answer nobody
  in this repository chose, is what turns that into a refusal at wiring time."

   Two spellings for one code point is a wart, but the mapping is explicit and
   total in one direction: a scheme absent from this table is refused by name
   rather than passed through to be silently rejected as
   `:signature/unknown-scheme`, which reads like a provider limitation when it
   is really a missing entry here.

   `tls.cert` does not need this -- it dispatches from the wire code point
   directly -- which is why the only user is a caller that already has a
   parsed scheme keyword."
