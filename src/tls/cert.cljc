  "[RFC 8446](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446.html) §4.4 — the
  certificate half of a TLS 1.3 client: the `Certificate` message, the
  `CertificateVerify` signed content, and the decision about whether the peer
  on the other end is the one we meant to reach.

  ## Three things this is, and one it is not

  1. **A parser for bytes that arrived from the network.** Every length prefix
     in `Certificate` and `CertificateVerify` is attacker-controlled, and a
     length that runs past the buffer is the oldest bug in the protocol. Each
     prefix is bounds-checked against the enclosing structure's end rather than
     against the end of the array, so an inner length cannot borrow octets from
     an outer field. A refusal names the field it happened in.

  2. **A dispatcher, by name and never by default.** A `SignatureScheme` this
     does not accept is refused with the scheme's registry name, and the ones
     TLS 1.3 forbids in `CertificateVerify` — the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 family — are
     refused with their own reason rather than with \"unsupported\". A verifier
     that falls through to a default on an unknown code verifies something
     other than what the peer claimed to sign.

  3. **A decision, returned as a value.** `authenticate-peer` answers
     `[:ok {…}]` or `[:error {:reason …}]`. Nothing here throws: errors are
     values, per this workspace's language rules, and a refusal a caller cannot
     name is a refusal an operator cannot act on.

  What it is **not** is a path validator. `authenticate-peer` does not build or
  check a chain to a trust anchor — see its docstring, which says so in those
  words, and the `:tls/not-checked` set it returns, which says so in data.

  ## The parser is `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-x509`

  Certificate bytes go to `x509.core`, which is the same parser the CMS,
  RFC 3161 and PAdES paths in this workspace use. A TLS client with its own
  X.509 parser would be a second answer to \"whose key is this\", and only one
  of the two would get fixed.

  ## The pin is SHA-256 of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo

  `spki-sha256-hex` is the format the rest of this workspace already pins with:
  `aiueos.provider.cloud/spki-sha256-hex` computes `sha256(PublicKey.getEncoded())`,
  and `PublicKey.getEncoded` is exactly the SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER. Over the
  key rather than the certificate, so renewal with the same key is not an event
  and a key change is."

  trusts, and it does not mean the leaf's issuer signature was checked, and it
  does not mean the certificate has not been revoked. It means the checks named
  in `:tls/checked` passed; `:tls/not-checked` names the rest, in the value, so
  a caller that logs the decision logs the limit with it.

  **Pin mode is the mode.** The pin is SHA-256 of the leaf's
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo, which is what the rest of this workspace already does
  (`aiueos.provider.cloud/spki-sha256-hex`, `grant.cloud/admit-peer`), and it
  needs no root store — which is the reason it is first: a cloud-premised OS
  with no filesystem has nowhere to put one. An empty pin set is refused rather
  than treated as \"no constraint\".

  Each check has its own refusal, so an operator can tell which one fired:
