  "The TLS presentation language -- RFC 8446 section 3 -- over byte vectors.

  Bytes here are `vector<int 0..255>`, the same representation
  `kotoba-lang/bytes`, `kotoba-lang/noise` and `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-asn1` use,
  so nothing in this library needs a reader conditional and the same code runs
  on the JVM, in ClojureScript and under nbb.

  ## Reading is a cursor, not a sequence of `drop`s

  Every parse in TLS is `read n bytes, then read what they said`. A parser that
  does that with `take`/`drop` over a lazy sequence silently succeeds on
  truncated input, because `(take 4 [1 2])` is `[1 2]`. Here a cursor knows
  how many bytes are left and `need` refuses before reading, so truncation is
  a `:decode_error`, not a short value that flows on into a length field.

  ## Vectors carry their bound

  RFC 8446 writes `opaque legacy_session_id<0..32>`, and those bounds are not
  documentation: `legacy_session_id` is length-prefixed with one byte, so a
  33-byte session id is *encodable* and only the declared bound rejects it.
  `read-vector` and `write-vector` both take the bound and enforce it."
