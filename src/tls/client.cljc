(ns tls.client
  "A TLS 1.3 client: full 1-RTT handshake, then application data.

  Pure, in the sense that matters: this namespace opens no socket and reads no
  clock. It is driven by a `transport` map of two functions,

      {:send (fn [bytes] ...)   ; write bytes, return anything
       :recv (fn [] bytes)}     ; block for at least one byte, [] on EOF

  and a `provider` supplying the cryptography. `tls.transport.jvm` is one
  implementation of the former; a WASM host or aiueos would be another.

  ## What this client does not do

  Said plainly, because a TLS client that quietly skips a check is worse than
  no TLS client:

  - **No trust-anchor chain validation.** Peer authentication is by SPKI pin
    (`:pin-spki-sha256`) or, if the caller explicitly passes
    `:insecure-skip-peer-auth`, not at all. There is no root store here, no
    name constraints, no CRL, no OCSP. `tls.cert` (another agent's file) is
    where that will live.
  - **No HelloRetryRequest.** One key share, X25519, and a refusal naming the
    group the server asked for if it wants another.
  - **No resumption, no 0-RTT, no PSK, no client certificates.**
  - **No KeyUpdate.** A `key_update` from the peer is a refusal, not a
    silently-ignored message: ignoring it desynchronises the keys and the next
    record fails with no explanation.
  - **No record-boundary reassembly of a handshake message across a *key
    change*.** Messages are reassembled across records within one flight,
    which is what real servers need; a message split across the
    ServerHello/EncryptedExtensions key boundary cannot legally occur.

  ## What it does check

  Every one of these has a negative test:

  - the ServerHello is TLS 1.3 by `supported_versions`, not by
    `legacy_version` (section 4.1.3)
  - `legacy_session_id_echo` matches what was sent
  - the cipher suite and key-share group were both offered
  - the server's `CertificateVerify` signature is over the section 4.4.3
    context string and the transcript, and verifies against the leaf's SPKI
  - the server's `Finished` verifies against the handshake traffic secret
  - the peer's SPKI matches the pin, when one is given"
