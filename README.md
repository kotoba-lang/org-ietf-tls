# kotoba-lang/org-ietf-tls

**A TLS 1.3 client — [RFC 8446](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446.html) —
in portable `.cljc`, with every cryptographic primitive injected.**

It completes a real handshake against a real server and moves application data.
It authenticates the peer **by public-key pin**, not by chain validation to a
trust anchor. Read *What you must not assume* before using it for anything.

```clojure
(require '[tls.client :as client]
         '[tls.transport.jvm :as tp]
         '[tls.result :as r])

(let [t (tp/socket-transport "kotobase.net" 443 {:timeout-ms 15000})
      conn (r/val (client/handshake provider t
                    {:server-name "kotobase.net"
                     :pin-spki-sha256 "50602ad366823fcf5274a7c917baa4fd24b9de4fd15635ff501177c83d05473e"}))]
  (client/write! conn (tls.codec/ascii "GET /llms.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: kotobase.net\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n"))
  (r/val (client/read! conn))     ;=> {:tls/content [72 84 84 80 ...]}
  (client/close! conn))
```

## What actually ran

Two live handshakes, both reproduced by `scripts/` in this repo.

| against | suite | CertificateVerify | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `openssl s_server` on loopback, Ed25519 certificate, OpenSSL 3.6.3 | `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` | `ed25519` | handshake, `GET /`, **7 KiB HTTP response**, `close_notify` |
| **`kotobase.net:443`** (Cloudflare), over the public internet | `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` | `ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256` | handshake, 3-certificate chain, `GET /llms.txt`, **6,391-byte body**, `close_notify` |

Both verified the server's `CertificateVerify` signature over the section 4.4.3
context string and the transcript, verified the server's `Finished`, sent their
own `Finished`, and matched the leaf SPKI against a pin.

The same live path, run with a deliberately wrong pin against the same server,
**refuses**:

```clojure
#:tls{:alert :bad_certificate, :reason :spki-pin-mismatch,
      :expected "aaaa…aaaa",
      :actual   "50602ad366823fcf5274a7c917baa4fd24b9de4fd15635ff501177c83d05473e"}
```

## RFC 8448 is the oracle

A cryptographic implementation checked only against itself is worth nothing.
[RFC 8448](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8448.html) publishes byte-exact
traces of a complete TLS 1.3 handshake — every intermediate secret, every
serialized `HkdfLabel`, every protected record. Section 3 is reproduced here
**byte for byte**:

- the X25519 shared secret, from the RFC's own private and public keys
- the whole ladder: early → derived → handshake → `c/s hs traffic` → derived →
  master → `c/s ap traffic` → `exp master` → `res master`
- the serialized `HkdfLabel` for `derived`, `c hs traffic`, `key`, `iv`,
  `finished` — checked *separately* from their outputs, because a wrong info
  block and a wrong PRK produce the same wrong answer and only this
  distinguishes them
- both directions' handshake and application traffic keys and IVs
- **all six protected records**, decrypted *and* re-encrypted to the identical
  ciphertext (AES-GCM is deterministic given key and nonce, so this is a real
  equality, not a round-trip through our own code)
- both `Finished` messages' `finished_key` and `verify_data`
- the resumption PSK

The vectors are **not transcribed by hand**. `scripts/extract_rfc8448.cljs`
parses them out of the RFC's own text; each block in the RFC declares its own
octet count and the extractor refuses to emit one that does not reach it
exactly. The fixture records the SHA-256 of the input it came from
(`6564d137…`), so a reader can re-fetch and re-derive.

## What you must not assume

`authenticate-peer` returns what it checked **and what it did not**, in the
value, so a caller that logs the decision logs the limit with it. From a live
run against `kotobase.net`:

```clojure
:checked     #{:leaf-usable :basic-constraints :server-name :spki-pin}
:not-checked #{:chain-to-trust-anchor :issuer-signature :revocation
               :name-constraints :certificate-transparency :validity}
```

- **There is no chain validation.** No root store, no path building, no
  issuer-signature check, no name constraints, no CRL, no OCSP, no certificate
  transparency. An `[:ok …]` does not mean the certificate chains to anything.
  Identity comes from the SPKI pin and nothing else.
- **`handshake` refuses to proceed** unless you pass `:pin-spki-sha256`, a
  `:verify-chain` function, or the explicit `:insecure-skip-peer-auth`. There is
  no default, because a client that authenticates nothing and returns success
  is worse than one that fails.
- **Expiry is checked only if you pass `:now`.** This library reads no clock —
  "was it valid when it signed" and "is it valid now" are different questions
  and only the caller knows which it is asking. Without `:now`, `:validity`
  appears in `:not-checked`; an expired certificate accepted knowingly and one
  accepted silently must not produce the same map.
- **Hostname matching happens only if you pass `:server-name`**, which the
  ClientHello needs anyway, so in practice it does. It is RFC 6125 §6.4 over
  `subjectAltName` `dNSName` entries: a wildcard is the entire leftmost label
  of a name with at least three labels and consumes exactly one. `commonName`
  is never a fallback. Pass `:check-server-name? false` to skip it.
- **No HelloRetryRequest.** One X25519 key share. If the server wants another
  group the handshake refuses and names it. Servers that require P-256 are
  unreachable.
- **No resumption, no 0-RTT, no PSK, no client certificates, no ALPN
  negotiation, no KeyUpdate.** A peer `KeyUpdate` is refused rather than
  ignored — ignoring one desynchronises the keys silently.
- **Only `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` and `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`.**
  `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` is not offered: it needs SHA-384, and offering a
  suite the provider may not carry is negotiating into a handshake that cannot
  finish. Which of the two is offered is *computed from the provider*
  (`tls.suite/negotiable`), not declared.
- **Timing.** The protocol layer is not written to be constant-time beyond the
  two comparisons that must be (`verify_data`, and AEAD tags, which are the
  provider's). Byte vectors of boxed integers are not a constant-time
  representation and nothing here claims otherwise.

## Layout

| namespace | RFC 8446 | what it owns |
|---|---|---|
| `tls.result` | — | `[:ok v]` / `[:error e]`. Nothing throws; every error carries the alert a peer would receive |
| `tls.codec` | §3 | the presentation language: cursor-based reads, `opaque x<lo..hi>` with its bounds, `u64` written with division so a 64-bit sequence number does not round |
| `tls.alert` | §6 | alert descriptions; `close_notify`/`user_canceled` may be warnings, everything else is forced fatal |
| `tls.transcript` | §4.4.1 | the message-level transcript (headers included), forkable at the four points TLS needs |
| `tls.schedule` | §7, RFC 5869 | HKDF, `HkdfLabel`, `Derive-Secret`, the ladder, traffic keys, `Finished`, KeyUpdate, resumption, exporter |
| `tls.record` | §5 | TLSPlaintext / TLSInnerPlaintext / TLSCiphertext, the §5.3 nonce, padding, size bounds |
| `tls.extension` | §4.2, RFC 6066 | extension framing; unknown extensions round-trip byte-exactly; duplicates refused |
| `tls.handshake` | §4 | message framing and bodies; HelloRetryRequest detection; the §4.1.3 client checks |
| `tls.suite` | App. B.4 | suite geometry bound to the provider's AEAD |
| `tls.cert` | §4.4 | the `Certificate` message, the `CertificateVerify` signed content, and the peer-identity decision |
| `tls.provider` | — | the crypto seam, as data: the contract, the validator, and the reason set |
| `tls.provider.jvm` | — | the JDK-backed provider. Byte arrays |
| `tls.provider.vectors` | — | adapts a byte-array provider to the byte-vector protocol layer, and refuses one that fails a published known answer |
| `tls.client` | — | the driver: handshake, `write!`, `read!`, `close!` |
| `tls.transport.jvm` | — | a TCP socket. Two functions, `:send` and `:recv` |

## Two byte representations, on purpose

The protocol layer works in `vector<int 0..255>` — the representation
`kotoba-lang/bytes`, `kotoba-lang/noise` and `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-asn1`
already share. That is not taste: byte vectors have **value equality**, so
`(= expected actual)` on a 679-octet record is a real assertion and a failure
prints the divergence. Byte arrays compare by identity, and a suite written
against them would be asserting `Arrays/equals` everywhere or asserting
nothing.

`tls.provider` speaks byte arrays, because that is what `MessageDigest`, `Mac`,
`Cipher` and `Signature` take.

`tls.provider.vectors/adapt` is the single conversion between them, using
`asn1.core`'s `->ints` / `ints->bytes` rather than a third pair. It **refuses**
a provider that fails `tls.provider/validate` or any of three published known
answers — SHA-256 of the empty string (FIPS 180-4), RFC 4231 test case 1, and
RFC 7748 §5.2's X25519 vector.

That check is not ceremony. The provider answers `[:error :hash/bad-input]`
when handed something that is not a byte array, and **`[:error :hash/bad-input]`
is itself a vector**: passed on as a digest it gives the key schedule a
two-element "hash", derives secrets nobody agrees with, and fails on the far
side with no local diagnostic. Checking once, against answers nobody in this
repository chose, turns that into a refusal at wiring time.

## The provider seam

Nothing in `src/` implements a cipher. The seam is copied deliberately from
`kotoba-lang/noise`, which states the argument: constant-time field arithmetic
and constant-time tag comparison are exactly what a hand-rolled portable port
loses, so those come from an audited implementation while everything that is
pure data-shuffling stays portable and identical on every runtime.

Say the consequence plainly: **on bare metal, where there is no JDK and no npm,
the provider is precisely the part that does not exist.** This library does not
close that gap. It reduces it from *a TLS stack* to *X25519, AES-GCM or
ChaCha20-Poly1305, SHA-256, HMAC, and one signature verify* — which is close to
what `kotoba-lang/aiueos` already has in `x25519.kotoba` and `sha256.kotoba`.

## What was reused rather than rewritten

Searched first (44,192 source files under `orgs/`, plus the west manifest's
4,229 project names and the concept index). There was **no TLS 1.3 protocol
implementation anywhere** — `capability-crypto-tls` is `provider-status:
contract-only`, and `io-storj-node` / `provider-transport` both call the *host's*
TLS 1.2. What did exist and is used or is directly adjacent:

| repo | what it gives |
|---|---|
| `kotoba-lang/noise` | the injected-primitive seam this copies, and its security argument |
| `kotoba-lang/org-nist-sha2` | pure `.cljc` SHA-256 + HMAC — the whole key schedule can run with **no host crypto at all** |
| `kotoba-lang/bytes` | the `vector<int 0..255>` byte contract |
| `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-x509`, `org-ietf-asn1` | RFC 5280 / X.690 — what `tls.cert` will build chain handling on |
| `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-tcp` | RFC 9293 TCP as a pure state machine — the layer below, for when there is no socket |
| `kotoba-lang/org-ietf-ed25519` | Ed25519, for a provider without a JDK |

## Encrypted ClientHello (`tls.ech`)

**draft-ietf-tls-esni-25.** The client sends two ClientHellos: a
`ClientHelloOuter` naming the client-facing server's `public_name`, and a
`ClientHelloInner` — the real one, with the real SNI — encrypted into the
outer's `encrypted_client_hello` extension with HPKE.

This is the ECH **data plane**: configurations, `EncodedClientHelloInner` and
its reconstruction, `ClientHelloOuterAAD`, the seal and open, and the
acceptance confirmation. Both halves are here, client and client-facing
server.

**It is not wired into `tls.client`.** Offering ECH in a live handshake also
needs HelloRetryRequest, §6.1.6's retry-config path, and a second transcript —
and doing that halfway would produce a client that offers ECH and cannot tell
whether it was accepted, which is worse than one that does not offer it.

### ECH is not an RFC and has no test vectors

Measured, not assumed: the datatracker gives `draft-ietf-tls-esni` no RFC
number at revision 25, and the draft text contains no test-vector section. So
none of the ECH tests are known-answer tests, and none are labelled as though
they were. The evidence is of three kinds, kept apart:

**Live configurations.** `test/tls/ech_configs.cljc` holds `ECHConfigList`
values pulled from real HTTPS resource records — Cloudflare's, and defo.ie's,
which publishes three configs in one list. Parsing bytes that are actually
deployed is the only part of this that is not self-consistency.
`scripts/fetch_ech_configs.cljs` refreshes them, and it carries **no sha256
pin**, unlike every other generator in this workspace: servers rotate ECH keys
daily by design, so pinning that input would make the script refuse every time
it was right.

**Two-sided round-trip.** Every client operation has a server-side counterpart
in the same namespace, and the tests run both — including the compression
path, where the inner hello names extensions instead of repeating them and the
server puts the outer's copies back.

**The aborts.** §5.1 names four conditions under which a client-facing server
MUST abort while reconstructing the inner. Each has its own reason and its own
test. Three of them exist to stop a small ClientHelloOuter decompressing into
a huge ClientHelloInner (§10.12.4); they are not tidiness.

### What the ECH tests discriminate

| break | failures | which tests go red |
|---|---|---|
| the HPKE `info` drops the ECHConfig | **15** | the pinning test **only** |
| seal without `ClientHelloOuterAAD` | **5** | the round-trips and the binding test |
| keep the inner's `legacy_session_id` | **4** / **1** | two call sites, two tests |
| skip the outer-extensions order check | **1** | the aborts test |
| accept non-zero padding | **1** | the aborts test |
| drop §6.1.3's no-SNI padding rule | **1** | the padding test |
| *(restored)* | **0** | none |

The first row is the one worth reading. **Both halves of ECH live in one
namespace, so a symmetric change to the HPKE `info` leaves every round-trip
green** — it is only wrong against a peer. Dropping the ECHConfig from the
info broke nothing at all until `config-info` was pulled out and pinned to the
draft's text. A two-sided test cannot check a value both sides agree on.

### Two bugs this found, both in the shape the rules warn about

**A context map silently replaced the error reason.** `tls.result/error`
merges the caller's data *over* `{:tls/alert :tls/reason}`, so
`(error :decrypt_error :ech-open-failed {:tls/reason ...})` reported the inner
reason instead of the stable keyword. Nothing would have noticed if the tests
asserted "an error happened" rather than **which** error.

**A test's expected value hit the `(map int "…")` trap.** On the JVM that is
code points; under ClojureScript it is a vector of zeros — the trap
`hpke.kdf/ascii` documents, walked into by a test written to check exactly
that kind of thing. The seven bytes of `"tls ech"` are now written out, with
`(map char …)` back to the string as the cross-check.

### The ClojureScript path covers the ECH tests, and only those

The rest of this suite is `.clj` because the cryptographic provider is
injected and the one that exists is the JVM's. ECH's data plane is different —
its crypto is `org-ietf-hpke`, which is portable — so the parser, the
reconstruction and the confirmation derivation run on both runtimes, and the
codec underneath them is byte arithmetic, which is exactly where the two
runtimes differ.

```sh
nbb --classpath "$(clojure -A:cljs -Spath)" scripts/verify-cljs.cljs
```

**922 assertions there; 1,472 for the whole suite on the JVM.** The runner
names its one namespace rather than globbing, and **exits 2 if it executed no
assertions at all** — a runner that quietly found nothing to run would
otherwise report success.

## Test

```sh
clojure -M:test                   # plain clojure.test
clojure -M:report                 # the same tests, with counts
```

Verified in three directions, through the alias: unmodified → **exit 0**; one
vector byte corrupted → **exit 1** (`549 passed, 1 failed`); fixture removed →
**exit 3** and `COULD-NOT-RUN  refusing to report a pass`.

`tls.report` (see below for the invocation) exits **3**, not 1, when it could not run its vectors at all — a
suite that could not measure has not found a bug, and reporting one is its own
kind of lie. It refuses to report a pass on zero vectors compared or zero
refusals exercised.

Live runs are `scripts/live_loopback.clj` and `scripts/live_kotobase.clj`; they
are not part of the default suite because they need a network.
