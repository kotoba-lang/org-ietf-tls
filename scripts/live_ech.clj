;; A live handshake WITH Encrypted ClientHello, against a server that serves it.
;;
;;   clojure -M scripts/live_ech.clj [host] [corrupt]
;;
;; The ECHConfigList is fetched from the host's HTTPS resource record over
;; DNS-over-HTTPS, which is where a real client gets it. Nothing is pinned:
;; the point of this script is not the certificate, it is whether a **real
;; server** accepts what this client encrypts -- and the server says so by
;; putting the acceptance confirmation in ServerHello.random.
;;
;; That is the only external evidence available for ECH. The draft is not an
;; RFC and publishes no test vectors, so short of a live server agreeing, every
;; check this repository can run is the two halves of `tls.ech` agreeing with
;; each other.
;;
;; The corrupt run is also the only way to exercise draft s6.1.6 against a
;; real deployment: the server cannot decrypt, rejects ECH, and the client
;; finishes the handshake against the public_name to collect retry_configs
;; before aborting with ech_required.
;;
;; NOTE what this script does not check. It passes :insecure-skip-peer-auth,
;; so the public name is not actually authenticated here -- s6.1.7 requires
;; that before the retry configs may be used, and a caller that wants them
;; must pass :ech {:public-name-pin ...}. The script reports what the server
;; sent; it is not a demonstration that acting on it would be safe.
;;
;; It talks to the public internet and it depends on someone else's deployment,
;; so it is a script and not a test.
