  "The client's ECH wiring: the two hellos it builds, and how it judges
  acceptance.

  A `.clj` rather than `.cljc` because `tls.client` takes an injected provider
  and the one that exists is the JVM's. `tls.ech`'s own tests run on both
  runtimes; this one exercises the part that cannot.

  There is no TLS server here. What is checked instead is the property that
  matters and that a server would check: **the outer this client sends can be
  opened by a client-facing server holding the config's private key, and
  reconstructs to exactly the inner hello the client composed.** That is the
  server's whole job in §5.1, run against the client's real output rather than
  against a hand-built fixture."
