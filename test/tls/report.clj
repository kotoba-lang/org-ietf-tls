(ns tls.report
  "A test entry point that prints what it measured and refuses a silent pass.

  Run with `clojure -M:test -m tls.report`.

  Root ADR-2608136000: a check that could not run must never return the value
  of a check that ran and found nothing wrong. The default `clojure.test`
  summary satisfies that only by accident -- `Ran 0 tests, 0 failures` exits 0
  and reads as success. So this:

  - counts the RFC 8448 blocks in the fixture and the ones actually compared
  - counts the refusals exercised
  - exits non-zero if either count is zero, or if the fixture is missing, even
    with no failing assertion

  The exit code for `could not answer` is deliberately not 1: a suite that
  could not run its vectors has not found a bug, and reporting one is its own
  kind of lie."
