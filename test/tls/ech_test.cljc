  "ECH — draft-ietf-tls-esni-25 — with the three kinds of evidence kept apart.

  **The draft is not an RFC and publishes no test vectors.** Measured: the
  datatracker gives `draft-ietf-tls-esni` no RFC number at revision 25, and
  the text contains no test-vector section. So nothing below is a known-answer
  test, and none of it is labelled as though it were.

  What there is instead:

  1. **live configurations** — `ECHConfigList` values pulled from real HTTPS
     resource records. Parsing bytes that are actually deployed is the only
     part of this that is not self-consistency.
  2. **two-sided round-trip** — every client operation has a server-side
     counterpart in `tls.ech`, and both run.
  3. **the aborts** — §5.1 names four conditions under which a server MUST
     abort, and each is asserted by its own reason. These matter more than
     they look: three of them exist to stop a small ClientHelloOuter
     decompressing into a huge ClientHelloInner (§10.12.4)."
