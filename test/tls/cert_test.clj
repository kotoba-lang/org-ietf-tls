  "Both directions, for everything.

  Every refusal `tls.cert` can produce has a case here that produces exactly
  that refusal, and the fixture that produces it is broken in exactly one
  place — the assertion is on the reason keyword, not on \"an error happened\",
  because a test that goes red for a different reason has demonstrated nothing.

  The positives are against octets this repository did not make: RFC 8448's
  handshake trace, Google Trust Services' certificate for `kotobase.net`, and
  an Ed25519 signature OpenSSL produced over a CertificateVerify content that
  shell built rather than this library. A parser tested only against its own
