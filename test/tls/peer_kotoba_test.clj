;; `kotoba/tls/peer.kotoba` against `tls.cert`.
;;
;; Held against the repository's own DER fixtures and the real JVM provider,
;; so the certificate the guest is asked about is the one the library is
;; asked about.
;;
;; ## Two findings
;;
;;   * `an-expired-certificate-authenticates` -- `authenticate-peer`
;;     compares `:tls/now` against the certificate's validity with
;;     `compare`, which is byte order. The certificate's two ends come from
;;     `asn1/time-value` and are always `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`; the caller's
;;     instant is whatever the caller wrote. `"2020-04-01T00:00:00-05:00"`
;;     is 05:00Z, five hours after this fixture expired, and it
;;     authenticates -- with `:validity` in `:tls/checked`, so the result
;;     says the check ran.
;;
;;   * `a-name-a-client-wants-must-be-a-name` --
;;     `server-name-matches?`'s first clause is `(= p w)`, before any of the
;;     wildcard rules, so a WANTED name carrying a `*` matches the pattern
;;     it is. And a name with an empty label matches, because `str/split`
;;     produces the empty string and empty strings compare equal.
;;
;; Parity covers the wildcard rules the library gets right, which is most of
;; them: entire leftmost label, three labels, one label consumed, no partial
;; wildcards, ASCII-insensitive, trailing dot ignored.
