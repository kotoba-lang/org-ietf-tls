  "Both directions.

  A verifier that has never rejected anything is not evidence. Every admission
  path in this library has an entry here, and each asserts the *exact* refusal
  -- the `:tls/reason` keyword and the `:tls/alert` a peer would receive --
  not merely that something went wrong. Asserting only `(r/error? ...)` would
  pass if the code refused for the wrong reason, which is how a check that has
  quietly stopped working keeps looking healthy.

  Each test also names what it broke, so that `the break and the report agree`
  is checkable by a reader rather than assumed."
